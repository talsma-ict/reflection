## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

Although we hate bugs, we love people taking the trouble to report them! :+1:  

- Before creating bug reports, please check 
  [whether it already exists](https://github.com/talsma-ict/reflection/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
  as you might find out that you don't need to create one.  
  If a report already exists **and it is still open**, please add a comment to this issue 
  instead of opening a new one.  
  In case is was already closed, feel free to open a new issue and link to the closed issue in the description.
- When you _do_ create a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

### How do I submit good bug report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).  
New issues can be [created here](https://github.com/talsma-ict/reflection/issues/new).
Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, _don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it_.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

If you can, please consider [creating a pull-request](https://github.com/talsma-ict/reflection/compare) 
in which you add a (failing) unit-test that points out the bug.
