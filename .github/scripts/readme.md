# CI scripts

These CI scripts originate (and are maintained) in 
[their own repository on github](https://github.com/talsma-ict/ci-scripts).

They were merged in using an additional remote that was added as follows:
```shell
git remote add ci-scripts https://github.com/talsma-ict/ci-scripts.git && git remote set-url --push ci-scripts DISALLOWED
```
